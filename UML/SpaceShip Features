SpaceShip features

1) Move the ship around the screen
2) Rotate the ship clockwise when D is pressed
2) Rotate the ship counter clockwise when A is pressed
4) I want the ship to rotate in any direction 360 degrees
5) Increase velocity slowly when W is pressed
6) If the ship goes off the board have it appear on the other side
7) If the ship hits something explode
8) I want the ship to continue on its current path, but still be able to rotate
9) Use encapsulation so the application is more flexible

The Player

1) Starts the game
2) Move the ship
    a) Rotate the ship
    b) Increase the velocity of the ship
3) If the ship crashes start over

Risks / Problem Code

1) 360 degree rotation means we have to use doubles
2) Polygons are built using int arrays
3) Floating point calculation lose precision
4) How do we slowly increase velocity
5) How can we rotate the ship while maintaining the current course
6) How do we move the ship when it goes off the board

AffineTransform allow us to:

1) Use doubles for rotation
2) Let the polygon be an int array but have the center be a double
3) When the ship goes off the board just change the center points

Solves: 1, 2, 3, 6

Create velocity methods that increase and decrease velocity

Have a rotation angle for current movement
Have a rotation angle for the ships rotation

Solves: 4, 5

-------

Scenario

1) Draw polygon in the center of the screen with points surrounding the center points
    a) GameBoard width and height
    b) Center points for polygon x & y
    c) Polygon x & y int array
    d) Might need upper left hand corner x & y ?

2) Player increase the ship velocity
    a) x & y velocity

3) Player rotates ship
    a) Rotation angle
    b) Movement angle
    c) Calculate movement angle

4) Player hits a rock and blows up
